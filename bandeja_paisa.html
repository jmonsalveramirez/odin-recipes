<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the Chicharrones: Place pork belly on a rimmed baking sheet. Stir
    together salt, sugar, and cumin; rub evenly on pork. Wrap pork in plastic
    wrap, and chill 6 to 12 hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 425°F. Unwrap pork, and place, fat side up, on a lightly
    greased wire rack. Place rack in a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until
    golden brown and crispy, about 30 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce oven temperature to 250°F, and cook until pork is tender when pierced
    with a fork, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Wrap pork in plastic wrap, and
    chill until firm, at least 1 hour.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cut pork into 4 strips. Cut 3/4-inch deep slits crosswise in pork at 1-inch
    intervals. Heat a large skillet over medium. Cook pork until golden brown
    and crispy, about 4 minutes per side.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Hogao: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onions, bell
    pepper, and achiote paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about
    8 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, garlic, cumin, and salt. Cook, stirring often,
    until tomatoes have broken down and thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from
    heat, and stir in cilantro.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Frijoles Rojos: Place beans in a medium bowl; add water to cover
    by at least 2 inches. Cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drain beans. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low. Add pork belly; cook,
    stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in beans, broth,
    Hogao, cumin, and salt. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.
    Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans
    are tender, 4 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours, adding water, 1 cup at a
    time, if mixture becomes too thick.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Carne Molida: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add
    beef; cook, stirring to break into pieces, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes.
    Stir in Hogao, salt, and cumin; cook, stirring often, until well combined
    and heated through, about 2 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Chorizo: Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook
    chorizo links, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked
    through, about 15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Arepas: Combine masarepa, cheese, water, salt, and 1 tablespoon
    of the oil in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until dough is smooth.
    (Dough will look soupy, but will firm up after standing.) Cover and let
    stand 10 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Shape dough into 4 (4-ounce) balls. Gently flatten each into a
    1/2-inch-thick disk (about 3 1/2 inches in diameter). Heat remaining 2
    tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook arepas until
    golden brown and charred in spots, about 5 minutes per side.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Tajadas de Plátano: Cut plantains diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick
    slices. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook plantains, in
    batches, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate
    lined with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prepare the Huevos Fritos: Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium.
    Break eggs into pan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until whites
    are set and starting to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evenly divide Chicharrones, Frijoles Rojos, Carne Molida, Chorizo, Arepas,
    Tajadas de Plátano, Huevos Fritos, rice, avocados, and remaining Hogao among
    4 platters. Garnish with cilantro, and serve immediately.
